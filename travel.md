## Flights ##

We suggest flying in and out of Anchorage. By car, Seward is approximately three hours from Anchorage. If there is sufficient interest, we will arrange for group transportation to and from Anchorage.

## Accomodations ##

The LFQIS Workshop 2017 will be held at the [Hotel Seward](www.hotelsewardalaska.com/), near downtown Seward. We recommend reserving rooms as early as possible, as Seward is a popular tourist destination.

## Safety ##

As the workshop gets closer, we will update this page with safety information for attendees interested in pursuing outdoor activities while in Seward.
